#Datasets

There are two datasets to analyse, which have a common identifier to allow the joining of the datasets for further analysis.  Neither file contains any real data, they exist only for the purpose of this task so there's no need to consider privacy/data protection, think of them as extracts from a fictional web site. 

Both files are stored in CSV format, and there's a description of the structure of each file below:

##accounts_20161130.csv

This file contains an extract of all accounts created on our fictional system up to midnight on the 30th Novemer 2016.  Accounts must be set up to enable access to the website.  Accounts can be deleted, which should prevent any further access to the site.

##traffic.csv
